0. given desired pressure pTarget and temperature tTarget
1. read temperature from hot and cold storage (tHot/tCold)

- volume inversely proportional to pressure
- gas mixer mixes by moles and function of temperature

- furnace gas is either too hot or too cold
- we add a specific ratio of hot/cold gas to get the
  temperature and pressure perfect

tTarget/pTarget = tCur/pCur * ?

C_x : heat capacity of gas x at a constant volume

C_a T_a+C_b T_b = C_a T_{eq}+C_b T_{eq}
$T_{eq} = \frac{C_a T_a+C_b T_b}{C_a + C_b}

T_{eq} = C_V

50%/50% at 300K/300K
rA0 = 50%
rB0 = 100% - rA0 = 100% - 50% = 50%
rT = 300K/300K = 1.0
rA =        r * rA0 =        1.0 * 50%              = 50%
rB = 100% - r * rB0 = 100% - 1.0 * 50% = 100% - 50% = 50%

50%/50% at 200K/400K
rT = 200K/400K = 0.5
rA =        r * 50% =        0.5 * 50% =            = 25%
rB = 100% - r * 50% = 100% - 0.5 * 50% = 100% - 25% = 75%
